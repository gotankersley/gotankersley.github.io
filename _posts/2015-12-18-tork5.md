#About
This is version of the board game [Pentago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago).  It is notable to me because it is the first, (and hopefully the last) time I try to write a [bitboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard) implementation in javascript using javascript's *float* type, which is insane!

Floats in javascript give you *53* bits of precision - however, you can only do bitwise operations on *32* bits at a time.  This meant writing helper functions for all the common bitwise operations, for example this *xor* function:

{% highlight javascript %}
function xor(x, y) {
    return ((x/0x100000000) ^ (y/0x100000000)) * 0x100000000 + ((x^y)>>>0);    
}
{% endhighlight %}

While this ended up working, it's rarely a good sign when you're constantly amazed that your own implementation actually works, and is a complete nightmare to debug.  Since then I've had [some success](/kulami) in switching over to using [javascript typed arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) for my javascript bitboard needs.

#More Madness
But wait - there's more...  Usually it's convenient to layout the bitboard so that it's convenient to map a **[row, column]** position to **bit** position.  However, to make it easier to rotate the quad boards, it is arranged thusly:  

{% highlight javascript %}
/* (Comment taken from the Board class) */
Bit positions:
0 | 1 | 2   ||  9 |10 |11           Quads:
7 | 8 | 3   ||  16|17 |12           Q0 | Q1
6 | 5 | 4   ||  15|14 |13           --------
_________________________           Q2 | Q3
-------------------------
18|19 |20   ||  27|28 |29
25|26 |21   ||  34|35 |30
24|23 |22   ||  33|32 |31
{% endhighlight %}

This allowed for quads to be rotated using a bitshift operation.
