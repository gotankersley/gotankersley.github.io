Abstract strategy game<!--more-->. [Play here](/kulami).

# About
This is an implementation of the board game [Kulami](http://www.foxmind.com/jeux/1478-kulami).  While a fairly simple implementation, it does support irregular arrangements of tiles in a 10x10 grid, which allows for a lot of interesting variations.

# AI 
It took me a little while to appreciate this game dues to its abstract nature.  However, it does seem to be a game that is skewed very heavily in favor of the computer because:

- The small branching factor, with the exception of the 1st move, decreases rapidly until a computer can easily see the end game from 12+ moves away

- The static evaluation function is pretty much just calculating the current score, (which can be done incrementally) 

- And this is a game about calculating score - something trivial to a computer - but _waaay_ too much math for a person to do mentally

- The different board configurations - they don't seem to affect the AI's algorithm, but each configuration requires a slightly different human strategy

However, the award for the most persistent definitely goes to [jacsn](https://jacsn.net/), who worked tirelessly in his quest to defeat the AI.

# Other notes
- I tried to do some analysis by seeing if I could find some pattern between winning / losing / tieing certain tiles by having it play a bunch of simulated games, and averaging the results on a per-tile basis.  And while there did seem to be some interesting data, I couldn't find any Deus Ex Machina for winning, and so didn't dig much deeper

- During development, the project name I used for this was **Salami**, partially as a play on the name **Kulami**, and partially because the inital board had a sort of meaty look to it:
